<h2>Our Company</h2>
<p>
Mr. Chan Kwok Wa founded the company in 2009, starting from a small business
and growing it to become a major contractor for multiple chain stores, dedicated
by his relentless efforts. Before 2009, the company operated as a sole
proprietorship and officially transitioned into a limited company that same year.
One of our long-term clients is The Dairy Farm Company Ltd. and we have
worked together for over 20 years.
During this period, we have also collaborated with numerous groups of varying
sizes, aiding their growth and development, from small operations to public
listings. These achievements stem from Mr. Chan's over 40 years of rich
experience. He has utilized his expertise to help various companies successfully
transform, expand, and go public. Our company remains committed to fulfilling
customer needs at the lowest possible cost.
